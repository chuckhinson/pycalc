This project was an exercise in learning python, and in particular doing GUID programming in python.

The calculator is meant to mimic on old-style physical four-function calculator that has a single display (i.e., I wasnt trying to replicate a modern calculator app you might have on your phone)

There's still more I could do to improve the code (like making it fully object-oriented), and I'm not entirely happy with the divide-by-zero handling.
